// Control signals are used to control the flow of execution in a program.
// They are used to break out of loops, skip iterations, or redo the last operation.
// These signals are typically used in conjunction with control flow statements like loops and conditionals.
// They are not intended to be caught by the user, but rather to be used internally by the framework.
